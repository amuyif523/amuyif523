Hi, I'm Amanuel Fikremariam ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate developer and data science enthusiast based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,

My single-minded focus for the next two years is to achieve a world-class level of expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I am publicly documenting my entire journeyâ€”from the first line of Python to deploying production-ready models. My approach is built on relentless learning, building practical projects, and a commitment to solving real-world problems with data.

Follow my journey as I build my skills in public.
